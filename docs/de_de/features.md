## Mod Features

#### Dead Coral and Coral Fans Erode into Sand

Provides additional *Sand* and *Red Sand*

Disable with `/carpetskyadditions removeDefault coralErosion`

Dead Coral and Dead Coral Fans with water flowing out of them will spawn a Sand item every 16-32 seconds. Fire versions spawn Red Sand instead.

The Coral has a 3% chance to break after spawning Sand.

Infinitely automatic farms are possible, but not trivial.

This method was added because:

- Getting Sand purely from the Wandering Trader is not sufficient.
- Gravity block duping and Trader multi-use bugs are unintended and could be fixed at any time.
- The old method where Husks dropped Sand is boring as it's just another standard mob farm.

#### Vexes Can Be Allayed

Provides *Allays*

Disable with `/carpetskyadditions removeDefault allayableVexes`

Play Vexes the right sequence of 5 Note Block notes to convert them to Allays.

Vexes listen to Note Blocks within a 16 block range and emit particles based on whether the correct note is played. The instrument is ignored and the octave is ignored, meaning F#<sub>3</sub> is treated the same as F#<sub>5</sub>.

When a Vex is in a Minecart, a Comparator can be used with a Detector Rail to determine the next note in the sequence. The Comparator outputs a value from 0 (corresponding to F#) to 11 (corresponding to F)
