## Datapacks

### Modifying

To customize the datapack,
download the datapack from [releases](https://github.com/jsorrell/CarpetSkyAdditions/releases)
and edit to your liking.

Disable the built-in datapack and enable your edited one instead.

#### Structures ####
Configured features can be overridden to replace the default world spawn platform and Sky Island platform.

The world spawn platform uses a configured feature defined in
`data/carpetskyadditions/worldgen/configured_feature/spawn_platform.json`.
By default, it loads the structure defined in `data/carpetskyadditions/structures/spawn_platform.nbt`
at an offset of (-4, -1) at y=63.

Sky Islands generated from the command use a configured feature defined in
`data/carpetskyadditions/worldgen/configured_feature/sky_island.json`.
They fall back to the world spawn platform if this isn't defined.
