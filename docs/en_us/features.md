## Mod Features

#### Dead Coral and Coral Fans Erode into Sand ####

Provides additional *Sand* and *Red Sand*

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault coralErosion```

Dead Coral and Dead Coral Fans with water flowing out of them will spawn a Sand item every 16-32 seconds.
Fire versions spawn Red Sand instead.

The Coral has a 3% chance to break after spawning Sand.

Infinitely automatic farms are possible, but not trivial.

This method was added because:

- Getting Sand purely from the Wandering Trader is not sufficient.
- Gravity block duping and Trader multi-use bugs are unintended and could be fixed at any time.
- The old method where Husks dropped Sand is boring as it's just another standard mob farm.

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault renewableDeepslate```

Right-clicking or dispensing a Thick Potion on Stone converts it to Deepslate.

A Thick Splash Potion will convert Stone blocks hit by the splash into Deepslate.

The conversion chance equals twice the percentage of the potion duration an entity would get.

A Thick Lingering Potion will continuously convert all Stone blocks in its cloud into Deepslate.

#### Netherrack and Nylium Generates with Nether Portal Structures ####

Provides *Netherrack and Nylium*

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault renewableNetherrack```

When a Nether Portal generates in the void, it generates a few blocks of Netherrack or Nylium around it.

Netherrack elsewhere.

#### Vexes Can Be Allayed ####

Provides *Allays*

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault allayableVexes```

Play Vexes the right sequence of 5 Note Block notes to convert them to Allays.

Vexes listen to Note Blocks within a 16 block range and emit particles based on whether the correct note is played. The
instrument is ignored and the octave is ignored, meaning F#<sub>3</sub> is treated the same as F#<sub>5</sub>.

When a Vex is in a Minecart, a Comparator can be used with a Detector Rail to determine the next note in the sequence.
The Comparator outputs a value from 0 (corresponding to F#) to 11 (corresponding to F)

#### Budding Amethysts Can Be Generated ####

---

#### Sniffers are Suspicious ####

Provides *Suspicious Sand* and *Suspicious Gravel*

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault suspiciousSniffers```

Disable only Iron Nugget drops with ```/carpetskyadditions setDefault suspiciousSniffers no_iron```

Sniffers will dig in Sand, Red Sand, Suspicious Sand, Gravel, and Suspicious Gravel.

They dig up Iron Nuggets from these materials.
This Iron Nugget is more for lore than as an Iron source,
but it can provide a passive Iron source before an Iron Golem farm is built.

Digging has a 10% chance to convert Sand into Suspicious Sand when it's within a Desert Pyramid or Warm Ocean Ruin
and a 10% chance to convert Gravel into Suspicious Gravel when it's within a Trail Ruin or Cold Ocean Ruin.

Suspicious blocks will have the loot table of the structure they are created in.
In Trail Ruins, it will have a 20% chance to have the rare Trail Ruins loot table.
In a Desert Pyramid, it will have a 20% chance to have a Desert Well loot table.

---

#### Enchanting Tables Near Wardens can Enchant Items with Swift Sneak ####

#### Wandering Traders Can Spawn Riding Camels ####

Provides *Camels*

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault traderCamels```

When a Wandering Trader spawns in a Desert or Badlands biome (tag `carpetskyadditions:wandering_trader_spawns_on_camel`),
it will not have Trader Llamas, but will ride a Camel.

The Camel will despawn when the Wandering Trader does if the Trader is still riding it.

While the Wandering Trader is riding, the Camel can't be ridden, fed, or leashed.

Note: When installed only on the server side, the Trader will appear to be standing on the Camel,
instead of sitting. Also, feeding or leashing the ridden Camel will appear use the Cactus or Lead.
This is client side only, but I recommend not trying to mess with the Trader's Camel.

---

#### Small Dripleaves Can Propogate ####

Provides additional *Small Dripleaves*

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault spreadingSmallDripleaves```

When a Small Dripleaf is planted on Clay such that the bottom half is waterlogged, the top isn't,
and the top is at exactly light level 5, it can spread. Spreading works similarly to Mushrooms.

It only spreads to blocks which match the same conditions.
It can spread to a location up to 5 blocks away horizontally and 2 vertically.
Closer blocks are more likely.
It can only spread to locations with a maximum of 15 Small Dripleaf blocks (both halves counted) in a 5x2x5 area around.

In SkyBlock worlds, Small Dripleaves are normally very limited,
as they can only be obtained through the Wandering Trader, 10 at a time.
This allows farming and heavier use of them.

---

#### Coral can Spread to Calcite ####

Provides additional *Coral Blocks*

Disable with ```/carpetskyadditions removeDefault spreadingCoral```

When a Calcite block has at least 8 of the same type of Coral block within a 3x3 around it,
it can convert to that Coral block upon a random tick (if it would survive).

The chance of conversion depends on the suitability of the location.
The suitability is based on the [generation temperature and continentalness parameters](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome#Overworld_3).
The ideal spot is defined as a temperature of 0.65 and a continentalness of -0.3,
which translates to just off the coast, in warm locations.
These values are visible on the F3 screen in singleplayer.
The algorithm is:
```
if dimension is not overworld then
    suitability = 0
else if flat world then
    suitability = 0.5
else
    # This value is clamped between 0 and 1
    suitability = 1 - ((temperature - 0.65)^2 + (continentalness + 0.3)^2)
```

The chance of conversion upon a random tick is `suitability * 0.49 + 0.01`.

When most suitable, conversion takes about 2 minutes on average.
When least suitable, it averages almost 2 hours.

In SkyBlock worlds, Coral Blocks are normally very limited,
as they can only be obtained through the Wandering Trader, 8 at a time.
This allows farming and heavier use of them.
